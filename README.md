# Overview

This program is the game tic-tac-toe. This version of the game requires two players to take turns placing X's and O's to create a line while blocking there opponent from doing the same. 
One of the reasons that I wanted to write this program is that I have never made anything with a user interface that was outside of the terminal. This was a fun way of programming a user interface because with the 
Forms library you could place and assign buttons for the project as needed. This was a fun project to try building a user interface for as it involved user input that would display the X's and O's on the screen. 
I look forward to building more projects with Forms and seeing what else I can do with them in the future.
